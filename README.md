# clearText

my team's  model is: 
"clear text" For better OCR text image recognition on degraded images, by using image super resolution.

it's hard for OCR to recognize degraded text image. (original image ->  OCR : 97.9%,   degraded image ->  OCR: 62.6%)

We will turn the degraded text image (using deep learning) into a text image that ocr can read better.
It will be public.
